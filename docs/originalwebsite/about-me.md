# Hello, World! 
My name's Pieter. I'm currently a Senior at the University of Washington, where I'm studying Computer Science. After graduation, I'll be joining Tableau in Palo Alto!

# Books
Here's some books I enjoyed reading over the last four years.

## Fiction  
Someone once said to me that they didn't think there was anything to learn from fiction. I couldn't disagree more, and have found that novels have fostered as much personal growth as nonfiction has professional.  
- [Tortilla Flat](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/163977.Tortilla_Flat) - A subtle and slow (but short) story following a house of friends. How do humans give meaning to their lives and defeat boredom?
- [Our Sister Killjoy](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/231558.Our_Sister_Killjoy) - I think this novel was written as a response to Joseph Conrad's *Heart of Darkness*. What would the colonial narrative look like, inverted and through the eyes of an African student living in Europe? 
- [The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy](https://www.goodreads.com/series/40957-the-hitchhiker-s-guide-to-the-galaxy) - A hilarious series with the traditional subversion of tradition found in comedy. How do humans find happiness and confidence in a universe seemingly indifferent to their existence?
- [One hundred years of Solitude](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/320.One_Hundred_Years_of_Solitude) -  A biblical allegory following the generations of a single family. What is human nature and what do we share with our ancestors?
- [The Lord of the Rings](https://www.goodreads.com/series/66175-the-lord-of-the-rings) - Needing little introduction this work asks just about every "stone tower" question about human nature. How does greed manifest and appear in humans?

## Non Fiction 
- [Bad Indians: A Tribal Memoir](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15894219-bad-indians?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=YMAV3YjAH8&rank=1) - What does (some of) American history look like from the perspective of a Native American family?
- [America is In the Heart](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/253813.America_Is_in_the_Heart) - How did America greet immigrants from the Philippines in the 20th century? 
- [Data Feminism](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51777543-data-feminism?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=nABo6OLn72&rank=1) - What power is held in data? How does this affect those not in places of power? 
- [Death in the Haymarket](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/171634.Death_in_the_Haymarket) - Follows the events following a labor protest in  
- [The Soul of a New Machine](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7090.The_Soul_of_a_New_Machine) - What do office politics and working on a (very competitive) team look like?
