When I was finishing college I got setup with GitHub pages and this [arctic-fox-theme](https://github.com/diezcami/arctic-fox-theme). I was looking for the quickest possible way to get a decent looking website. I only wrote a couple posts and moved them (mostly unedited) here while moving to this cool new [just-the-docs](https://github.com/just-the-docs/just-the-docs) template.
